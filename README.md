The project revolves around hospitality analytics, with data from multiple properties of AtliQ Hotels analyzed using Power BI. The key metrics presented include Revenue, RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), occupancy percentage, realization percentage, and cancellation percentage, with insights categorized by city, property name, day type, room class, and booking platform.

## Key Insights:

## Overall Performance:

Total Revenue: ₹1.69 billion.
RevPAR: ₹7,336.56.
Occupancy Rate: 57.79%.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): ₹12,695.75.
Realization Percentage: 70.14%.


## Revenue and Room Analysis:

Highest Revenue-Generating Properties: AtliQ Exotica (Mumbai) and AtliQ Palace (Delhi).

## Revenue by City:
Mumbai generated the highest revenue at ₹669 million, making it the strongest performing city.

Delhi, in contrast, reported the lowest revenue, totaling ₹290.2 million, suggesting a potential area for growth.

Revenue by Room Class: Highest revenue came from Elite and Premium room classes.

Weekend vs Weekday Performance: Higher RevPAR and occupancy rates were observed on weekends, with a 62.64% occupancy on weekends vs. 55.85% on weekdays.

## City-wise Performance:

Occupancy: Delhi had the highest occupancy rate at 60.44%, followed by Hyderabad and Mumbai.

Bookings: Mumbai contributed the most bookings.

## Platform-wise Performance:

Most Popular Booking Platforms: “Others” and "makeyourt…" (likely Makemytrip) generated the most revenue and bookings.

Highest ADR: The direct booking platform had one of the highest ADRs but not the highest realization percentage.

## Cancellations and Ratings:

Cancellation Rate: Around 24% across properties.

Average Rating: Overall rating of 3.62 with little variation by booking platform or day type.

## Final Insights:
Revenue Optimization: With Mumbai leading revenue generation and Delhi lagging behind, targeted strategies to increase bookings and occupancy in Delhi could help narrow the revenue gap.

Platform Strategy: Direct bookings seem underutilized compared to aggregators, so enhancing the direct platform's visibility could yield better control and margins.

City Focus: Efforts to boost performance in cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad may enhance property utilization.
